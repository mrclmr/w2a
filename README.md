# w2a (workout to audio)

w2a converts a workout YAML file with text-to-speech (TTS) into audio files, enabling a seamless and guided exercise experience.

![overview.png](docs/overview.png)

I made this program because simple audio files make it easier for me to follow the specific exercises I need and want to do each day. I also wanted to capture the helpful tips physicians give me â€” things they often say just once, but I forget soon after.

## [Installation](docs/installation.md)

## Example

1. Create the documented `example.yaml` file
   ```
   w2a --example > example.yaml
   ```
  
2. Create sound files in `output-w2a/`
   ```
   w2a example.yaml
   ```
